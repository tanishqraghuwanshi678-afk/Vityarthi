Project Statement
Campus Lost & Found System
1. Introduction

The Campus Lost & Found System is a simple Python-based console application designed to help students and staff record and retrieve information about lost or found items on campus. The purpose of this project is to create an accessible tool that organizes lost-and-found reports in a structured manner.

2. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

To provide a simple and efficient way to log lost or found items

To maintain a temporary list of item reports during program execution

To allow users to review all reported items

To demonstrate fundamental Python concepts such as loops, lists, dictionaries, and user input handling

3. Scope of the Project

This project includes:

A menu-driven Python program

User input fields for:

Item name

Location where the item was lost/found

Contact details

Display of all logged items

Session-based data storage (data resets when program restarts)

The project does not include:

Permanent database storage

Authentication or user accounts

Graphical user interface (GUI)

Online features

4. Problem Definition

Many campuses lack a convenient, unified system for reporting lost or found items. Information is often scattered, making it difficult for owners to reclaim lost belongings. This project solves that issue by creating a centralized, easy-to-use tool to store and review item logs.

5. Methodology

The solution is implemented using:

Python lists for item storage

Dictionaries to map item details

A continuous loop for menu navigation

Conditional statements for different user choices

Console input/output for interaction

Items are stored in the following structure:

{
    "item": "Wallet",
    "place": "Library",
    "contact": "9876543210"
}

6. Expected Outcomes

A functional text-based system for logging lost and found items

Clear and readable code suitable for beginners

A program demonstrating core Python programming principles

A foundation that can be expanded into a more advanced system

7. Conclusion

The Campus Lost & Found System is a simple yet effective program that organizes lost-and-found reports using basic Python data structures. It serves as an excellent starting point for learning menu-driven programming and can be enhanced into a more robust solution in future iterations.
