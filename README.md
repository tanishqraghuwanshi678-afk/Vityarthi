#  About the Project:

The Campus Lost & Found System is a lightweight Python application meant to solve a simple yet common issue: misplaced belongings on campus.
Instead of relying on manual logs or scattered information, this tool provides a structured way to record and view lost/found items in one place.

#  This project is perfect for:

-Beginner Python developers.
-Students learning basic data structures.
-Mini-project or assignment submissions.
-Demonstrations of menu-driven programs.

#  Key Features:

- Add lost or found items.
- View all submitted entries.
- Store item name, location, and contact.
- Simple, readable code.
- Beginner-friendly Python logic.
- Runs entirely from the console.
- No external libraries required.

#  Project Screenshots:

You can replace these with actual screenshots later.

===== Campus Lost & Found System =====
1. Add Lost/Found Item
2. View All Items
3. Exit
Enter your choice:

--- Lost & Found Items ---
1. Wallet - Library (Contact: 9876543210)
2. Water Bottle - Canteen (Contact: 9123456789)

#  How the System Works:

The program uses a while True loop to display a menu with three choices:

1. Add Lost/Found Item

Prompts the user for:
-Item name.
-Place where lost/found.
-Contact information.
-Then stores the data inside a list of dictionaries.

2. View All Items

-Shows every recorded item in a neat, numbered list.

3. Exit

-Safely terminates the program.

#  Installation:

Step 1 — Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/campus-lost-found.git

Step 2 — Navigate to the folder:
cd campus-lost-found

Step 3 — Make sure Python is installed:
python --version

#  How to Run:

Run the script with:
python src/lost_found.py

Or, depending on your OS:
python3 src/lost_found.py

#  Code Explanation (High-Level)
#  Data Structure

The items are stored as:

{
    "item": "Wallet",
    "place": "Library",
    "contact": "9876543210"
}

#  Main Components:

-List (lost_items) to store items.
-Dictionary for each item’s details.
-Menu loop for interaction.
-Conditionals for each user choice.

#  Example Code Snippet:
lost_items = []

while True:
    print("\n===== Campus Lost & Found System =====")
    print("1. Add Lost/Found Item")
    print("2. View All Items")
    print("3. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

    if choice == "1":
        item = input("Enter item name: ")
        place = input("Enter place where lost/found: ")
        contact = input("Enter your contact: ")

        lost_items.append({
            "item": item,
            "place": place,
            "contact": contact
        })

        print("\nItem added successfully!")

    elif choice == "2":
        print("\n--- Lost & Found Items ---")
        if len(lost_items) == 0:
            print("No items added yet.")
        else:
            for i, it in enumerate(lost_items, start=1):
                print(f"{i}. {it['item']} - {it['place']} (Contact: {it['contact']})")

    elif choice == "3":
        print("Exiting... Goodbye!")
        break

    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Try again.")

 #  Use Cases:

This project can be used for:

- School or college lost-and-found desks.
- Mini-project submissions.
- Learning how to manage user input.
- Understanding loops and dictionaries.
- Command-line application practice.  

#  Future Improvements:

Here are planned enhancements:

 - Save items to a text or JSON file.
 - Add search functionality.
 - Add item deletion or editing.
 - Add categories (electronics, documents, personal items, etc.).
 - GUI version using Tkinter.
 - Web version using Flask or Django.
 - Mobile version using Kivy.
