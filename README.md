#  Campus Lost & Found System

A beginner-friendly web application built using Python Flask that helps students report and find lost items on campus.

#  Project Overview

The Campus Lost & Found System allows users to:

- Submit details about lost or found items.
- View all items reported by others.
- Contact the owner/finder using the details provided.
- This project is perfect for first-year students as it uses very simple code, no database, and is fully written in one file.

#  Features

- Add item name, location, description, and contact.
- View all submitted items.
- Simple UI (HTML + CSS).
- No complex setup — runs locally.
- Beginner-friendly Flask code.

#  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTML/CSS (for UI)

#  How It Works

- When a user submits a form, the item is saved in a simple in-memory list.
- All items are displayed on the same page.
- The data resets when the server is restarted (because no database is used).
